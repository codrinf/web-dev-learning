# JS Types: Reference

JavaScript has 2 main reference types: `Object` and `Array`

## Object
Objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.

An object can be created with figure brackets `{â€¦}` with an optional list of properties. A property is a `key: value` pair, where `key` is a `string` (also called a **property name**), and `value` can be anything (a primitive or a reference type).

> In example below, we declare an object with some properties and their values:
```javascript
const employee = {
  firstName: "Vlad",
  lastName: "Popescu",
  age: 28,
  isInHoliday: true,
  skills: {
    html: true,
    css: true,
    js: false
  }
} 
```
